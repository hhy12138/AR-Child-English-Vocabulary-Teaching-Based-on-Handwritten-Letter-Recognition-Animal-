# Project Title

AR Child English Vocabulary Teaching Based on Handwritten Letter Recognition (Animal)


## Prerequisites
 

```
python3.7
tensorflow
unity(version over 2017.4.16f1)
```

## Installing

python3.7.1

```

```

tensorflow for mac

```
pip3 install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-0.11.0rc0-py3-none-any.whl
```

tensorflow for windows

```
pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/windows/cpu/tensorflow-0.12.0-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl
```
unity

```

## How to run

* run the unity and open the project named Machine Learning AR
* enter into the scene named HelloAR and click the "execution" button
* run the main.py
* place the picture with the handwritten word in front of the camera
* press the 'A' on the keyboard

## Flaws

* the system demands a high-quality picture of the handwritten word
* the 3D models of AR is quite simple and scarce(7 kinds of animals so far)
* the accuracy of recognizing the words is not perfect
